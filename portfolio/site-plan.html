      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <h4>What to include on your web design portfolio website</h4>
      <p>
        Your web design portfolio should be unique to you or your design agency
        — but there are standards elements that belong on every design
        portfolio.
      </p>
      <h4>Homepage/main landing page</h4>
      <p>
        Your homepage is perhaps the most important page within your portfolio
        website. While the main goal is to get potential clients’ eyes on your
        work and case studies, your homepage is what gets those visitors excited
        about your collection of work.
      </p>
      <h4>About page</h4>
      <p>
        Your about page is just that — all about you. This is your moment, so
        let your personality shine and tell a bit of your story. You can also
        use this page to further explain your introduction to design and what
        design means to you. This leaves a good impression on potential clients
        as they can learn more about how you approach your work.
      </p>

      <h4>Work/portfolio page</h4>
      <p>
        Whether you title it work or portfolio, this page should showcase your
        best design projects and their case studies. Curate your best projects —
        the work that highlights your skills as well as the style of work you
        love to do. Whenever possible, include thorough case studies that
        further explain your design process for the project and mockups from the
        final product.
      </p>

      <h4>Services</h4>
      <p>
        This is where you define the type of web design services you offer.
        Clients may have different ideas of what a web design package includes,
        so use this page to clearly explain what work you take on.
      </p>

      <h4>Contact page</h4>
      <p>
        Potential clients can’t hire you if they don’t know how to get in touch.
        A contact page that includes a contact form or your email address is
        key. The contact page is also a great place to share links to your
        social media and other relevant accounts like LinkedIn, Dribbble,
        Behance, and Medium.
      </p>

      <h1>List of 10 Best Front end Frameworks</h1>
      <p>
        The best 10 frontend frameworks in the field of web development are:
      </p>
      <h3>01. React</h3>
      <p>
        React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript
        library for developing user interfaces and related components. It
        employs the MVC architecture, with a different table of presentation and
        data availability. One of its distinguishing features is the Virtual DOM
        and how it handles document access and manipulation. The DOM interacts
        well with HTML and XML documents, causing them to behave similarly to a
        tree structure, and each HTML element functions as an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognised as a fantastic
        library in the front-end family of tools. It uses the JSX coding style,
        with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax to create the components. It
        breaks down larger components into smaller ones that can be managed
        separately and individually. With this feature, developers' overall
        productivity is bound to rise.
      </p>

      <h3>02. Angular</h3>

      <p>
        Angular is a best frontend framework that is dominating the list of web
        frontend frameworks. It is a framework for creating efficient and
        advanced single-page applications. It is a Typescript-based development
        platform developed by Google. Angular is a component-based framework for
        developing scalable web applications, as well as a set of tools for
        developers to use to create, build, test, and modify code, and a
        collection of well-integrated libraries.
      </p>

      <h4>Top JavaScript frameworks Source - Stackoverflow</h4>

      <p>
        Angular allows you to scale single-page applications to enterprise-level
        applications based on your needs. It is currently used by YouTube and
        Google Translate. It also has a lot of features, making it one of the
        most popular frameworks
      </p>

      <h3>03. Vue.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vue.js is a modern, progressive MVVM framework that takes advantage of
        incremental adoption to the greatest extent possible. Vue.js, as one of
        the best JavaScript libraries, has been creating interactive UI elements
        that are lightweight and easy to adapt. It provides data-reactive
        elements through a flexible and straightforward API. It is simple to
        complete smaller projects and then scale up to larger ones.
      </p>
      <h4>Top frontend frameworks Source - Stackoverflow</h4>

      <p>
        Vue.js is small in size and thus simple to install and download. Small
        and large level templates can be created, and errors can be identified
        quickly, saving time and effort. It simplifies the binding of existing
        applications and provides extensive documentation. It also assists
        developers in understanding peer frontend frameworks such as Angular.js,
        React.js, and others. Its MVVM architecture makes it easier to handle
        HTML blocks.
      </p>

      <h3>04. Svelte</h3>
      <p>
        Svelte is an innovative JavaScript compiler designed to produce
        high-performance user interfaces. Rich Harris created it in 2017 and it
        is still in its early stages of development. It is distinct in that it
        does not employ a virtual DOM. Instead, it employs a specialised
        JavaScript Virtual Machine designed specifically for creating user
        interfaces. This allows Svelte to be up to ten times faster than other
        platforms such as Angular and React frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Svelte is a good choice if you need a small and quick application
        developed by a small team of frontend developers, including beginners.
        Enroll in Website Developer courses to learn how to become a frontend
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't use Svelte for large project development because this frontend
        framework isn't widely used, and you might not be able to find the
        necessary help and tooling in its small community.
      </p>

      <h3>05. jQuery</h3>
      <p>
        jQuery is one of the oldest frontend frameworks available and is still
        popular among developers. John Resig created jQuery, a small, fast,
        feature-rich and one of the best frontend javascript frameworks library.
        It is a cross-platform library intended to make client-side HTML
        scripting easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        With an API that works across a wide range of web browsers, jQuery makes
        tasks like event handling, Ajax, animation, document traversal, and
        manipulation much easier. With its extensibility and versatility, jQuery
        has revolutionized the way designers write JavaScript. This is why
        jQuery is used by over 41 million websites.
      </p>

      <h3>06. Backbone.js</h3>
      <p>
        Backbone.js is a well-known JavaScript library that provides web
        applications with proper structure by providing models with customised
        events and major key-value binding. There are libraries of enriched APIs
        that include functions, declarative event handling, and views. It
        communicates well with the current API via a RESTful JSON user
        interface. It is lightweight because it only uses two JS libraries:
        Underscore.js and jQuery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This language is ideal for creating single-page web applications and
        keeping the multiple aspects in sync. With the help of the Backbone
        Layout Manager, developers can use predefined perspectives. It is
        thought to be useful for issues and corresponding and for areas with a
        lot of code. It provides a straightforward solution to the problems
        faced.
      </p>

      <h3>07. Ember.js</h3>
      <p>
        Ember is another open-source frontend framework to keep an eye on. It
        could assist you in developing modern user interfaces for internet
        solutions, mobile and desktop apps, and cross-platform applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        It adheres to the MVVM pattern. Ember generates a testing programme by
        default for each new entity, which is a useful feature. When you use
        Ember, you can always rely on the platform's ever-expanding community of
        brilliant developers to release and improve new features.
      </p>

      <h3>08. Semantic-UI</h3>
      <p>
        Semantic UI is a newcomer to the market of frontend frameworks (2014).
        It's a CSS framework created by full-stack developer Jack Lukicthis that
        is based on organic language syntax. LESS and jQuery are used to power
        it. In 2015 and later, it quickly rose to the top of the JavaScript
        projects on GitHub.
      </p>

      <h3>09. Foundation framework</h3>

      <p>
        Zurb's Foundation framework is a powerful front-end framework designed
        to help developers quickly prototype and build websites. It includes
        HTML and CSS components, JavaScript plugins, and Sass variables, as well
        as all of the functionality required for developing modern web
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Foundation, unlike other front-end frameworks, focuses on creating
        prototypes rather than production code. This enables teams to move
        quickly from a design to a functional prototype without having to spend
        time writing code.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to create a visually stunning, mobile-friendly website with
        a personalised user experience, use the Foundation framework. If
        developers have little experience dealing with customization complexity,
        don't use the Foundation framework.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Preact</h3>
      <p>
        Even though React is the most popular framework for frontend
        development, it has some flaws. As a result of this, the idea of
        creating a small-size framework with the same features as React arose.
        This is how Preact, a tiny version of React, came to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        Preact React and Preact have the same API and use the same app
        development methodologies. Preact, on the other hand, is much smaller in
        size and employs the thinnest and fastest virtual DOM possible. Preact
        is a good choice if you want to create a small application with no
        complex integrations that should perform a single function well. It
        should not be used if your project requires a large number of features.
      </p>

      <h1>Backend</h1>
      <h3>The 11 Best Backend Frameworks - 2023</h3>
      <p>[Written copy for the Page 3 here]</p>
      <h3>1. Spring</h3>
      <h4>Spring Programming Language Java</h4>

      <p>
        What is Spring Framework? The Spring Framework helps Java developers
        quickly develop complex, dynamic web applications. Spring is often
        referred to as a “framework of frameworks.” This is due to the varying
        Spring modules that you can pick and choose to use, such as Spring Web,
        Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cache, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Part of the framework, Spring Boot, makes stand-alone web applications
        and microservices far more efficient to code by minimizing time spent on
        boilerplate code and configurations. Spring Boot also supports many
        different Java Virtuation Machine (JVM) technologies, such as Kotlin,
        Groovy, and Scala.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spring Boot is considered an “opinionated” framework, meaning that it
        favors certain design patterns in order to make development within those
        patterns more efficient. In other words, Spring Boot decides the
        configuration defaults and the packages to install based on the
        dependencies you include in your project requirement. This can save time
        and headaches in development.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Django</h3>
      <h4>Django Programming Language Python</h4>

      <p>
        What is Django? Django is a high-level web framework that enables
        efficient development of fast, secure web applications in Python. Django
        uses a paradigm called model-view-template (MVT), which is a variation
        on the standard model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. Django's MVT
        paradigm helps you keep your code logically organized into layers. The
        Django framework handles many of the controller aspects of the model,
        leaving the specification of data view and presentation templates to
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Django is a batteries-included framework, meaning it includes most
        libraries and tools needed to build common web applications out of the
        box. Django's philosophy is to manage the data model in one location,
        namely your models.py file. Once the database is created and a
        connection established, everything should be done in Django, including
        schema updates and data migration, to avoid conflicts later.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Laravel</h3>
      <h4>Laravel Programming Language PHP</h4>

      <p>
        What is Laravel? Laravel is a cross-platform PHP framework that helps
        streamline the development of web applications using the
        model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. One of the original
        server-side web scripting languages, PHP has been around almost as long
        as the web, and Laravel is built atop PHP. While PHP no longer tops the
        list of the most in-demand programming languages, it persists based on
        legacy code, as it is used in nearly 80% of all websites
      </p>

      <h3>4. Flask</h3>
      <h4>Flask Programming Language Python</h4>

      <p>
        What is Flask? Flask is a simple, lightweight, and modular Python web
        framework that enables the developer to utilize third-party tools and
        libraries only as needed. While Django utilizes a “batteries included”
        approach, Flask keeps the core of a web application simple and
        extensible.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Ruby on Rails</h3>
      <h4>Ruby on Rails Programming Language Ruby</h4>

      <p>
        What is Ruby on Rails? Ruby on Rails is a web framework that enables
        Ruby developers to quickly build robust web applications with relative
        ease. Also referred to as “Rails,” Ruby on Rails uses the MVC paradigm,
        and provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web
        pages.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Express.js</h3>
      <h4>Express.js Programming Language JavaScript</h4>

      <p>
        What is Express.js? Express.js is a minimal framework for building fast
        responsive web applications, mobile applications and APIs. Express runs
        on top of the Node.js environment, and makes creating Node.js
        applications more efficient. Express.js is an unopinionated framework,
        which allows developers to structure their code to their personal
        preference instead of forcing a pre-defined code structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Millions of developers around the world use JavaScript for a variety of
        web development tasks. Originally created to provide interactivity for
        static web pages and run only in the browser, JavaScript can now also
        run backend code using the cross-platform, open-source server
        environment Node.js. This allows JavaScript to run outside of the
        browser, and has rich tooling available thanks to its ecosystem of
        helpful frameworks, including ExpressJS, NestJS, and MeteorJS - all of
        which make this list.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Next.js</h3>
      <h4>Next.js Programming Language JavaScript</h4>

      <p>
        What is Next.js? Next.js is a framework that allows for fast and
        efficient development of static website using React.js. Next.js is
        considered a minimalistic framework, while still containing all the
        necessary features to create a high performing application in React.
      </p>
      <h3>8. ASP.NET Core</h3>
      <h4>ASP.NET Core Programming Language .NET</h4>

      <p>
        What is ASP.NET Core? ASP.NET Core is a framework developed by Microsoft
        for creating applications using .NET. It is the next generation and
