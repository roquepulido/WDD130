            <h4>Spring Programming Language Java</h4>

            <p>
              What is Spring Framework? The Spring Framework helps Java
              developers quickly develop complex, dynamic web applications.
              Spring is often referred to as a “framework of frameworks.” This
              is due to the varying Spring modules that you can pick and choose
              to use, such as Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring
              Cache, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              Part of the framework, Spring Boot, makes stand-alone web
              applications and microservices far more efficient to code by
              minimizing time spent on boilerplate code and configurations.
              Spring Boot also supports many different Java Virtuation Machine
              (JVM) technologies, such as Kotlin, Groovy, and Scala.
            </p>

            <p>
              Spring Boot is considered an “opinionated” framework, meaning that
              it favors certain design patterns in order to make development
              within those patterns more efficient. In other words, Spring Boot
              decides the configuration defaults and the packages to install
              based on the dependencies you include in your project requirement.
              This can save time and headaches in development.

          <button class="accordion">02. Django</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <h4>Django Programming Language Python</h4>

            <p>
              What is Django? Django is a high-level web framework that enables
              efficient development of fast, secure web applications in Python.
              Django uses a paradigm called model-view-template (MVT), which is
              a variation on the standard model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.
              Django's MVT paradigm helps you keep your code logically organized
              into layers. The Django framework handles many of the controller
              aspects of the model, leaving the specification of data view and
              presentation templates to you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Django is a batteries-included framework, meaning it includes most
              libraries and tools needed to build common web applications out of
              the box. Django's philosophy is to manage the data model in one
              location, namely your models.py file. Once the database is created
              and a connection established, everything should be done in Django,
              including schema updates and data migration, to avoid conflicts
              later.

            <h4>Laravel Programming Language PHP</h4>

            <p>
              What is Laravel? Laravel is a cross-platform PHP framework that
              helps streamline the development of web applications using the
              model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. One of the
              original server-side web scripting languages, PHP has been around
              almost as long as the web, and Laravel is built atop PHP. While
              PHP no longer tops the list of the most in-demand programming
              languages, it persists based on legacy code, as it is used in
              nearly 80% of all websites

            <h4>Flask Programming Language Python</h4>

            <p>
              What is Flask? Flask is a simple, lightweight, and modular Python
              web framework that enables the developer to utilize third-party
              tools and libraries only as needed. While Django utilizes a
              “batteries included” approach, Flask keeps the core of a web
              application simple and extensible.

            <h4>Ruby on Rails Programming Language Ruby</h4>

            <p>
              What is Ruby on Rails? Ruby on Rails is a web framework that
              enables Ruby developers to quickly build robust web applications
              with relative ease. Also referred to as “Rails,” Ruby on Rails
              uses the MVC paradigm, and provides default structures for a
              database, a web service, and web pages.

          <button class="accordion">06. Express.js</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <h4>Express.js Programming Language JavaScript</h4>

            <p>
              What is Express.js? Express.js is a minimal framework for building
              fast responsive web applications, mobile applications and APIs.
              Express runs on top of the Node.js environment, and makes creating
              Node.js applications more efficient. Express.js is an
              unopinionated framework, which allows developers to structure
              their code to their personal preference instead of forcing a
              pre-defined code structure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Millions of developers around the world use JavaScript for a
              variety of web development tasks. Originally created to provide
              interactivity for static web pages and run only in the browser,
              JavaScript can now also run backend code using the cross-platform,
              open-source server environment Node.js. This allows JavaScript to
              run outside of the browser, and has rich tooling available thanks
              to its ecosystem of helpful frameworks, including ExpressJS,
              NestJS, and MeteorJS - all of which make this list.

            <p>
              What is Next.js? Next.js is a framework that allows for fast and
              efficient development of static website using React.js. Next.js is
              considered a minimalistic framework, while still containing all
              the necessary features to create a high performing application in
              React.

            <h4>ASP.NET Core Programming Language .NET</h4>

            <p>
              What is ASP.NET Core? ASP.NET Core is a framework developed by
              Microsoft for creating applications using .NET. It is the next
              generation and replacement for the Windows-only versions of its
              predecessor ASP.NET. ASP.NET Core is an open-source,
              cross-platform framework that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

            <h4>NestJS Programming Language JavaScript</h4>

            <p>
              What is NestJS? NestJS is a framework for building efficient,
              scalable web applications in the Node.js environment. NestJS is
              built on top of ExpressJS, and adds a level of abstraction to
              bring together concepts such as controllers, providers, and
              modules. NestJS supports both TypeScript and JavaScript.

            <h4>Meteor.js Programming Language JavaScript</h4>

            <p>
              What is Meteor.js? Meteor.js is written using Node.js, and can be
              used to build applications for web, iOS, Android, or desktop in
              Javascript or TypeScript. Meteor offers a full ecosystem to work
              with, and is known for enabling rapid prototyping and producing
              cross-platform code. Meteor can also be used with the ReactJS and
              AngularJS libraries.

            <h4>Cake PHP Programming Language PHP</h4>

            <p>
              What is CakePHP? Another PHP-based framework, CakePHP stresses
              conventions over configuration. Using an opinionated
              model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm, CakePHP applications require
              very little configuration to get started, while still providing
              the same data and security features as Laravel.
