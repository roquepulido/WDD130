          <button class="accordion">01. React</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript
              library for developing user interfaces and related components. It
              employs the MVC architecture, with a different table of
              presentation and data availability. One of its distinguishing
              features is the Virtual DOM and how it handles document access and
              manipulation. The DOM interacts well with HTML and XML documents,
              causing them to behave similarly to a tree structure, and each
              HTML element functions as an object.
            </p>
            <p>
              React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognised as a
              fantastic library in the front-end family of tools. It uses the
              JSX coding style, with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax to
              create the components. It breaks down larger components into
              smaller ones that can be managed separately and individually. With
              this feature, developers' overall productivity is bound to rise.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">02. Angular</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Angular is a best frontend framework that is dominating the list
              of web frontend frameworks. It is a framework for creating
              efficient and advanced single-page applications. It is a
              Typescript-based development platform developed by Google. Angular
              is a component-based framework for developing scalable web
              applications, as well as a set of tools for developers to use to
              create, build, test, and modify code, and a collection of
              well-integrated libraries.
            </p>

            <h4>Top JavaScript frameworks Source - Stackoverflow</h4>

            <p>
              Angular allows you to scale single-page applications to
              enterprise-level applications based on your needs. It is currently
              used by YouTube and Google Translate. It also has a lot of
              features, making it one of the most popular frameworks
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">03. Vue.js</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Vue.js is a modern, progressive MVVM framework that takes
              advantage of incremental adoption to the greatest extent possible.
              Vue.js, as one of the best JavaScript libraries, has been creating
              interactive UI elements that are lightweight and easy to adapt. It
              provides data-reactive elements through a flexible and
              straightforward API. It is simple to complete smaller projects and
              then scale up to larger ones.
            </p>
            <h4>Top frontend frameworks Source - Stackoverflow</h4>

            <p>
              Vue.js is small in size and thus simple to install and download.
              Small and large level templates can be created, and errors can be
              identified quickly, saving time and effort. It simplifies the
              binding of existing applications and provides extensive
              documentation. It also assists developers in understanding peer
              frontend frameworks such as Angular.js, React.js, and others. Its
              MVVM architecture makes it easier to handle HTML blocks.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">04. Svelte</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Svelte is an innovative JavaScript compiler designed to produce
              high-performance user interfaces. Rich Harris created it in 2017
              and it is still in its early stages of development. It is distinct
              in that it does not employ a virtual DOM. Instead, it employs a
              specialised JavaScript Virtual Machine designed specifically for
              creating user interfaces. This allows Svelte to be up to ten times
              faster than other platforms such as Angular and React frameworks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Svelte is a good choice if you need a small and quick application
              developed by a small team of frontend developers, including
              beginners. Enroll in Website Developer courses to learn how to
              become a frontend developer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don't use Svelte for large project development because this
              frontend framework isn't widely used, and you might not be able to
              find the necessary help and tooling in its small community.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">05. jQuery</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              jQuery is one of the oldest frontend frameworks available and is
              still popular among developers. John Resig created jQuery, a
              small, fast, feature-rich and one of the best frontend javascript
              frameworks library. It is a cross-platform library intended to
              make client-side HTML scripting easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              With an API that works across a wide range of web browsers, jQuery
              makes tasks like event handling, Ajax, animation, document
              traversal, and manipulation much easier. With its extensibility
              and versatility, jQuery has revolutionized the way designers write
              JavaScript. This is why jQuery is used by over 41 million
              websites.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">06. Backbone.js</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Backbone.js is a well-known JavaScript library that provides web
              applications with proper structure by providing models with
              customised events and major key-value binding. There are libraries
              of enriched APIs that include functions, declarative event
              handling, and views. It communicates well with the current API via
              a RESTful JSON user interface. It is lightweight because it only
              uses two JS libraries: Underscore.js and jQuery.
            </p>
            <p>
              This language is ideal for creating single-page web applications
              and keeping the multiple aspects in sync. With the help of the
              Backbone Layout Manager, developers can use predefined
              perspectives. It is thought to be useful for issues and
              corresponding and for areas with a lot of code. It provides a
              straightforward solution to the problems faced.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">07. Ember.js</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Ember is another open-source frontend framework to keep an eye on.
              It could assist you in developing modern user interfaces for
              internet solutions, mobile and desktop apps, and cross-platform
              applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              It adheres to the MVVM pattern. Ember generates a testing
              programme by default for each new entity, which is a useful
              feature. When you use Ember, you can always rely on the platform's
              ever-expanding community of brilliant developers to release and
              improve new features.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">08. Semantic-UI</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Semantic UI is a newcomer to the market of frontend frameworks
              (2014). It's a CSS framework created by full-stack developer Jack
              Lukicthis that is based on organic language syntax. LESS and
              jQuery are used to power it. In 2015 and later, it quickly rose to
              the top of the JavaScript projects on GitHub.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">09. Foundation framework</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Zurb's Foundation framework is a powerful front-end framework
              designed to help developers quickly prototype and build websites.
              It includes HTML and CSS components, JavaScript plugins, and Sass
              variables, as well as all of the functionality required for
              developing modern web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Foundation, unlike other front-end frameworks, focuses on creating
              prototypes rather than production code. This enables teams to move
              quickly from a design to a functional prototype without having to
              spend time writing code.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you want to create a visually stunning, mobile-friendly website
              with a personalised user experience, use the Foundation framework.
              If developers have little experience dealing with customization
              complexity, don't use the Foundation framework.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">10. Preact</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Even though React is the most popular framework for frontend
              development, it has some flaws. As a result of this, the idea of
              creating a small-size framework with the same features as React
              arose. This is how Preact, a tiny version of React, came to be.
            </p>

            <p>
              Preact React and Preact have the same API and use the same app
              development methodologies. Preact, on the other hand, is much
              smaller in size and employs the thinnest and fastest virtual DOM
              possible. Preact is a good choice if you want to create a small
              application with no complex integrations that should perform a
              single function well. It should not be used if your project
              requires a large number of features.
