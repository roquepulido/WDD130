          <h4>What to include on your web design portfolio website</h4>
          <p>
            Your web design portfolio should be unique to you or your design
            agency — but there are standards elements that belong on every
            design portfolio.
          </p>
          <h4>Homepage/main landing page</h4>
          <p>
            Your homepage is perhaps the most important page within your
            portfolio website. While the main goal is to get potential clients’
            eyes on your work and case studies, your homepage is what gets those
            visitors excited about your collection of work.
          </p>
          <h4>About page</h4>
          <p>
            Your about page is just that — all about you. This is your moment,
            so let your personality shine and tell a bit of your story. You can
            also use this page to further explain your introduction to design
            and what design means to you. This leaves a good impression on
            potential clients as they can learn more about how you approach your
            work.
          </p>

          <h4>Work/portfolio page</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you title it work or portfolio, this page should showcase
            your best design projects and their case studies. Curate your best
            projects — the work that highlights your skills as well as the style
            of work you love to do. Whenever possible, include thorough case
            studies that further explain your design process for the project and
            mockups from the final product.
          </p>

          <h4>Services</h4>
          <p>
            This is where you define the type of web design services you offer.
            Clients may have different ideas of what a web design package
            includes, so use this page to clearly explain what work you take on.
          </p>

          <h4>Contact page</h4>
          <p>
            Potential clients can’t hire you if they don’t know how to get in
            touch. A contact page that includes a contact form or your email
            address is key. The contact page is also a great place to share
            links to your social media and other relevant accounts like
            LinkedIn, Dribbble, Behance, and Medium.
