    <p class="about__me">
      Hello everyone, I'm from Mexico. I'm married with 4 kids 3 boys and 1 girl
      of 2 years. I like to know the way things work since I was a kid I always
      try to disassemble things. also, my father always had a computer so I
      start very early to use computers. I like to be self-learned, I studied a
      career in mechatronics and tried to learn how software and web development
      by myself but thanks to PathwayConnect I have the opportunity to get a
      bachelor's degree in applied technologies.
