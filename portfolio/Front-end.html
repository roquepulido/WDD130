          <h1>List of 10 Best Front end Frameworks</h1>
          <p>
            The best 10 frontend frameworks in the field of web development are:
          </p>
          <h3>01. React</h3>
          <p>
            React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript
            library for developing user interfaces and related components. It
            employs the MVC architecture, with a different table of presentation
            and data availability. One of its distinguishing features is the
            Virtual DOM and how it handles document access and manipulation. The
            DOM interacts well with HTML and XML documents, causing them to
            behave similarly to a tree structure, and each HTML element
            functions as an object.
          </p>
          <p>
            React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognised as a
            fantastic library in the front-end family of tools. It uses the JSX
            coding style, with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax to create the
            components. It breaks down larger components into smaller ones that
            can be managed separately and individually. With this feature,
            developers' overall productivity is bound to rise.
          </p>

          <h3>02. Angular</h3>

          <p>
            Angular is a best frontend framework that is dominating the list of
            web frontend frameworks. It is a framework for creating efficient
            and advanced single-page applications. It is a Typescript-based
            development platform developed by Google. Angular is a
            component-based framework for developing scalable web applications,
            as well as a set of tools for developers to use to create, build,
            test, and modify code, and a collection of well-integrated
            libraries.
          </p>

          <h4>Top JavaScript frameworks Source - Stackoverflow</h4>

          <p>
            Angular allows you to scale single-page applications to
            enterprise-level applications based on your needs. It is currently
            used by YouTube and Google Translate. It also has a lot of features,
            making it one of the most popular frameworks
          </p>

          <h3>03. Vue.js</h3>
          <p>
            Vue.js is a modern, progressive MVVM framework that takes advantage
            of incremental adoption to the greatest extent possible. Vue.js, as
            one of the best JavaScript libraries, has been creating interactive
            UI elements that are lightweight and easy to adapt. It provides
            data-reactive elements through a flexible and straightforward API.
            It is simple to complete smaller projects and then scale up to
            larger ones.
          </p>
          <h4>Top frontend frameworks Source - Stackoverflow</h4>

          <p>
            Vue.js is small in size and thus simple to install and download.
            Small and large level templates can be created, and errors can be
            identified quickly, saving time and effort. It simplifies the
            binding of existing applications and provides extensive
            documentation. It also assists developers in understanding peer
            frontend frameworks such as Angular.js, React.js, and others. Its
            MVVM architecture makes it easier to handle HTML blocks.
          </p>

          <h3>04. Svelte</h3>
          <p>
            Svelte is an innovative JavaScript compiler designed to produce
            high-performance user interfaces. Rich Harris created it in 2017 and
            it is still in its early stages of development. It is distinct in
            that it does not employ a virtual DOM. Instead, it employs a
            specialised JavaScript Virtual Machine designed specifically for
            creating user interfaces. This allows Svelte to be up to ten times
            faster than other platforms such as Angular and React frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Svelte is a good choice if you need a small and quick application
            developed by a small team of frontend developers, including
            beginners. Enroll in Website Developer courses to learn how to
            become a frontend developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Don't use Svelte for large project development because this frontend
            framework isn't widely used, and you might not be able to find the
            necessary help and tooling in its small community.
          </p>

          <h3>05. jQuery</h3>
          <p>
            jQuery is one of the oldest frontend frameworks available and is
            still popular among developers. John Resig created jQuery, a small,
            fast, feature-rich and one of the best frontend javascript
            frameworks library. It is a cross-platform library intended to make
            client-side HTML scripting easier.
          </p>

          <p>
            With an API that works across a wide range of web browsers, jQuery
            makes tasks like event handling, Ajax, animation, document
            traversal, and manipulation much easier. With its extensibility and
            versatility, jQuery has revolutionized the way designers write
            JavaScript. This is why jQuery is used by over 41 million websites.
          </p>

          <h3>06. Backbone.js</h3>
          <p>
            Backbone.js is a well-known JavaScript library that provides web
            applications with proper structure by providing models with
            customised events and major key-value binding. There are libraries
            of enriched APIs that include functions, declarative event handling,
            and views. It communicates well with the current API via a RESTful
            JSON user interface. It is lightweight because it only uses two JS
            libraries: Underscore.js and jQuery.
          </p>
          <p>
            This language is ideal for creating single-page web applications and
            keeping the multiple aspects in sync. With the help of the Backbone
            Layout Manager, developers can use predefined perspectives. It is
            thought to be useful for issues and corresponding and for areas with
            a lot of code. It provides a straightforward solution to the
            problems faced.
          </p>

          <h3>07. Ember.js</h3>
          <p>
            Ember is another open-source frontend framework to keep an eye on.
            It could assist you in developing modern user interfaces for
            internet solutions, mobile and desktop apps, and cross-platform
            applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            It adheres to the MVVM pattern. Ember generates a testing programme
            by default for each new entity, which is a useful feature. When you
            use Ember, you can always rely on the platform's ever-expanding
            community of brilliant developers to release and improve new
            features.
          </p>

          <h3>08. Semantic-UI</h3>
          <p>
            Semantic UI is a newcomer to the market of frontend frameworks
            (2014). It's a CSS framework created by full-stack developer Jack
            Lukicthis that is based on organic language syntax. LESS and jQuery
            are used to power it. In 2015 and later, it quickly rose to the top
            of the JavaScript projects on GitHub.
          </p>

          <h3>09. Foundation framework</h3>

          <p>
            Zurb's Foundation framework is a powerful front-end framework
            designed to help developers quickly prototype and build websites. It
            includes HTML and CSS components, JavaScript plugins, and Sass
            variables, as well as all of the functionality required for
            developing modern web applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Foundation, unlike other front-end frameworks, focuses on creating
            prototypes rather than production code. This enables teams to move
            quickly from a design to a functional prototype without having to
            spend time writing code.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to create a visually stunning, mobile-friendly website
            with a personalised user experience, use the Foundation framework.
            If developers have little experience dealing with customization
            complexity, don't use the Foundation framework.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Preact</h3>
          <p>
            Even though React is the most popular framework for frontend
            development, it has some flaws. As a result of this, the idea of
            creating a small-size framework with the same features as React
            arose. This is how Preact, a tiny version of React, came to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Preact React and Preact have the same API and use the same app
            development methodologies. Preact, on the other hand, is much
            smaller in size and employs the thinnest and fastest virtual DOM
            possible. Preact is a good choice if you want to create a small
            application with no complex integrations that should perform a
            single function well. It should not be used if your project requires
            a large number of features.
